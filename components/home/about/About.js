    I love sharing what I learn with others, especially teaching kids Python and robotics for FIRST Lego League. I also host workshops on various topics because I enjoy helping out on projects and learning new things. Oh, and Leetcode is my guilty pleasure!

    Outside of work and studies, you'll find me staying active with running, hitting the gym, playing tennis, and cycling. I'm also a cooking enthusiast who loves inventing new recipes. When I need some downtime, you'll catch me gamingâ€”Valorant and Chess are my go-to favorites.
